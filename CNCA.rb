  puts "It was a late December night. You were sitting alone at the bar, nursing a drink, when a plump, comforting man approached. Drunk and in need of solace, you agreed to follow him. During your conversation, he introduced himself as Alfredo—the owner of Hotel de Español, a nearby establishment. With a storm raging outside, Alfredo kindly offers shelter instead of letting you face the cold, wet night. You accept and follow him to his hotel."
